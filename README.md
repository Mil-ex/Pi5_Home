Hello dear fellas and welcome to my very first public github repository.
I'm an aerospace engineer from Germany and would like to share and improve some of my home projects. 

This projects is for everyone who is out-of-cash, but wants to have an own home server.
This project aims to create a all-in-one home server for all my needs:
1) Self-hosted NAS with 2 SSDs (Geekworm X1007 PCIe Pi5 hat)
2) Process and analyze data (e.g. finances from .csv files)
3) Grafana Server: dashboard to visualize data 
4) Show some of Pi's data on a small OLED screen
5) ...

This git repository shall be a reference guide to set everything up, learn how to use git properly, get better in programming and understanding Linux, the Pi and microcontroller, get new insights from others and expand the home server by new features and so on.

The Home Server has a custom made case (3D-printed), the above mentioned SSD-hat, a small 40x40 fan and an I2C OLED Display. 
You can find my Raspberry Pi5 Home Server case with further information here:

### Needed parts

### Software

Firstly the Operating System needs to be loaded onto an SD-Card. The OS is the RASPBERRY PI OS *LITE* (64-BIT).
